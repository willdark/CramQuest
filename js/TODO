TODO
1. Implement acceleration for changing directions --- Done
2. Make projectiles disappear --- Done
3. Background --- Done
4. Resizing the canvas when the window size changes.
5. Make diagonal speed the same as lateral speed.
6. Music --- Done
7. Objects should probably only know about their position. The game should query for their position and decide if they need to be disposed of.
  - The player should not be using an event to generate a projectile. The game should listen for a click, then tell the player to create a projectile and return it. The player can still store a list of its own projectiles.
  - Similarly, the game should probably be deciding when it is appropriate to destroy a projectile.

8. Make the projectiles come out the end of the player.
